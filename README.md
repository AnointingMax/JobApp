# JobApp

Personal project to create an on-demand staffing service for Nigerians using React Native

Hope you already have expo and react native installed

Run "npm install" to install all dependencies

Run "expo start" to run the expo dev server

You can use an emulator or your phone (by scaninng the barcode)
